# git-complimenter

A delightful npm package designed to boost your spirits! `git-complimenter` compliments you every time you commit to a Git repository. Dive into a coding session accompanied by positivity and encouragement.

## Features

- **Boosts Morale**: Receive an uplifting compliment with every commit.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with any Git repository.
- **Fully Customizable**: Fork and customize compliments to match your preferences.

## Installation

You can install `git-complimenter` globally on your machine using npm. This enables the compliments to be available across all your Git repositories.

```bash
npm install -g git-complimenter
```

# Usage
After installation, proceed with your Git operations as usual. git-complimenter works in the background, and you will see a compliment appear in your terminal after each commit you make.

There's no additional setup required in your project. Just keep committing, and git-complimenter will keep the compliments coming.

# How It Works
git-complimenter uses a Git post-commit hook to execute a script that outputs a random compliment. This hook is triggered after every commit you make to a Git repository.

# Customizing Compliments
Feel free to fork the project and customize the list of compliments. This allows you to personalize your experience or add context-specific encouragement for you and your team.
